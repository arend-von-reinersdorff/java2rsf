The program <a href="https://www.sosy-lab.org/people/beyer/CrocoPat/">Crocopat</a> was created - among other things - to find design patterns. But it has its own input format and cannot read Java source code directly. java2rsf attempts to bridge this gap by converting Java projects into Crocopat's input format (rsf).
